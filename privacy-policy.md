# Privacy Policy for GuardReel

**Last Updated:** January 27, 2026

GuardReel ("we", "our", or "us") operates the GuardReel mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our App.

## Information We Collect

### 1. Video Data (Local Only)
- **Tesla Dashcam Videos:** The App processes Tesla dashcam videos stored on your device or connected USB drives
- **Embedded Telemetry:** Speed, GPS coordinates, steering angle, and other vehicle data embedded in Tesla video files
- **Storage:** All video processing occurs locally on your device. We do not upload, transmit, or store your videos on any servers

### 2. Analytics Data
We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage data to improve the App:
- App opens and screen views
- Feature usage (exports, layouts used)
- Device type and iOS version
- Crash reports and performance data

This data is anonymized and cannot be used to identify you personally.

### 3. Advertising Data
We use Google AdMob to display advertisements:
- **With Tracking Permission:** If you allow tracking via App Tracking Transparency (ATT), ads may be personalized based on your interests
- **Without Tracking Permission:** You will see contextual (non-personalized) ads
- AdMob may collect device identifiers and ad interaction data per [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

### 4. App Tracking Transparency (ATT)
iOS requires us to ask permission before tracking your activity across other companies' apps and websites. You can:
- **Allow Tracking:** Receive personalized ads
- **Deny Tracking:** Receive non-personalized ads (the App functions identically either way)
- Change your choice anytime in iOS Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking
